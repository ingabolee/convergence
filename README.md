# A simple maths hypothesis:

Hypothesis: As we approach infinity, the convergence of all the numbers is 8

In this projects, digits of numbers are being multiplied recursively until they end up at one digit, which I call the convergence on the number.

Products with 0 are ignored

E.g 1356 : 1 * 3 * 5 * 6 = 90 which converges at 9 since 9 * 0 will be ignored

876: 8 * 7 * 6 = 336: 3 * 3 * 6 = 54: 5 * 4 = 20: 2 * 0(ignored): Convergence of 876 is 2
